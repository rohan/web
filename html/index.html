          <h2 class="heading">ABOUT ME</h2>
          I'm a 3rd year student at the University of Texas at Austin, seeking degrees in computer science, mathematics, and government. Since May 2014, I have been a member of the Turing Scholars, the computer science honors program at UT. I am a pod mentor, responsible for mentoring and advising new students, introducing them to the facilities and programs available to them, and helping them with the transition between high school and college. I am also a Computer Science Ambassador; I give tours of the building and chat with prospective students about being a student at UT.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was recently named a 2016 Archer Fellow. The Archer Fellowship is a semester-long program where students from the UT system spend a semester in Washington, DC, working full-time at an internship in the city while taking courses taught by UT professors. Around 50 students are selected each year; I am one of two computer scientists in my year and the only mathematics major to have been selected to the program.
          <br>
          <br>
          My academic interests can be divided into three sections. In computer science, I am doing research in probabilistic type theory in the context of natural-language database queries. In mathematics, my interests lie primarily in topology and algebra. In government, I am interested in constitutional law and public policy, especially as it relates to technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          I write for the <a href="http://cs.utexas.edu/blog">department blog</a>; some of my articles have received more than a thousand reads, and more than one student has informed me that my article on my first year at UT was the deciding factor in their decision to come to Austin. Furthermore, in Spring 2015, I had an op-ed published in the <i>Daily Texan</i>, UT's school newspaper; read the article <a href="www.dailytexanonline.com/2015/02/24/now-is-the-time-for-a-dedicated-college-of-computer-sciences-at-ut">here</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          I worked for three summers in high school at different labs, writing code and helping conduct research. I spent a summer building the tech stack at a small real estate management company in Houston, including setting up servers for data management. I interned at <a href="http://bloomberg.com">Bloomberg</a> in New York City from May until August 2014, where I worked on building a visualization tool for our volatilities data. I interned at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple Inc.</a> in Cupertino, CA from May until August 2015, where I worked on the Proactive Assistant team building internal tools and prototyping new software. I am interning at <a href="http://palantir.com">Palantir</a> in Washington, DC during summer 2016.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am also a singer, and since January 2015 have served as the Director of the <a href="http://songhorns.org">Texas Songhorns</a>, helping them learn new music and setting the organization's goals. (I am also our webmaster.) In December 2014, I was asked by my alma mater, <a href="http://sjs.org">St. John's School</a> in Houston, to perform as the soloist at our Christmas mass, and sang Ralph Vaughan Williams' <em>Fantasia on Christmas Carols</em>, a personal favorite of mine. I also play the piano, although much less diligently.

              πPrint (pronounced "pi-print") is a tool that sets up a CUPS-based print server on a Raspberry Pi connected to a printer. A website allows users to upload files onto the RPi (via a PHP script that runs some basic sanity checks against malicious users); a bash script is loaded every minute via a cronjob that finds connected printers, loads the first one, and prints everything in the upload folder. The uploaded files are then archived, and eventually deleted for security reasons. <a href="http://github.com/rohan/-Print">github link</a>

              Developed for HackRice 2014, modulus operandi (or mo) is a service that provides secure end-to-end encryption for file uploads. mo's primary feature is that all data is encrypted by the client, as opposed to by the server, to protect user privacy from man-in-the-middle attacks. Files can be uploaded via a command-line script, and can be shared in small groups with a known password.

              One of the projects assigned in honors Distributed Computing was to implement a chat room, backed by the asynchronous consensus algorithm Paxos.

The project was implemented over the course of two weeks in Java along with <a href="http://deholton.com/">Kyle DeHolton</a>.
